# 2D Peak Finding - Greedy-like Approach

## Problem Description

The 2D Peak Finding problem involves finding any peak element in a two-dimensional array. A peak element is an element that is greater than or equal to its neighbors. While traditional greedy algorithms may not directly apply, we can adopt a strategy based on certain observations.

## Greedy-like Approach

In this approach, we start from any column in the middle of the matrix and move to the neighboring column with a larger value. By repeating this process, we will eventually end up in a column containing a peak. This strategy is based on the idea of climbing up the matrix by always choosing the direction that leads to a larger value.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize**: Start from any column in the middle of the matrix.

2. **Find Maximum in Column**: Find the row with the maximum value in the current column.

3. **Check Peak Condition**: Check if the current element in the found row is greater than or equal to its neighbors.

4. **Return Peak**: If the condition is met, return the coordinates of the current element; otherwise, proceed to the next step.

5. **Move to Larger Neighbor**: Move to the neighboring column with a larger value. The specific strategy for choosing the neighboring column depends on the implementation.


## Time Complexity: 
O(m), where m is the number of rows.



### Pseudocode

```plaintext
function find2DPeakGreedy(matrix):
    rows = length(matrix)
    cols = length(matrix[0])
    
    # Start from the middle column
    col = cols / 2
    
    for i from 0 to rows - 1:
        # Find the maximum element in the current column
        max_row = findMaxInColumn(matrix, col)
        
        # Check if the current element is greater than or equal to its neighbors
        if (max_row == 0 or matrix[max_row - 1][col] <= matrix[max_row][col]) and
           (max_row == rows - 1 or matrix[max_row + 1][col] <= matrix[max_row][col]):
            return [max_row, col]
        
        # Move to the neighboring column with a larger value
        col = findLargerNeighbor(matrix[max_row], col)

# Helper function to find the row with the maximum value in a column
function findMaxInColumn(matrix, col):
    max_val = matrix[0][col]
    max_row = 0
    
    for i from 1 to length(matrix) - 1:
        if matrix[i][col] > max_val:
            max_val = matrix[i][col]
            max_row = i
    
    return max_row

# Helper function to find the index of a neighboring column with a larger value
function findLargerNeighbor(row, col):
    # Implementation depends on the specific strategy (e.g., choose the right neighbor)
    # For simplicity, let's assume the matrix is sorted in each row
    return col + 1
