# 1D Peak Finding - Divide and Conquer Approach

## Problem Description

The 1D Peak Finding problem involves finding any peak element in a one-dimensional array. A peak element is an element that is greater than or equal to its neighbors. The divide and conquer approach for 1D Peak Finding involves recursively dividing the array and searching for peaks in subproblems.

## Divide and Conquer Approach

The divide and conquer approach for 1D Peak Finding involves recursively dividing the array and searching for peaks in subproblems. Here is an overview:

1. Divide the array into two halves.
2. Compare the middle element with its neighbors.
3. If the middle element is greater than or equal to its neighbors, it is a peak.
4. If the middle element is less than its left neighbor, search in the left half.
5. If the middle element is less than its right neighbor, search in the right half.

## Time Complexity 
O(log n), where n is the size of the array. (Assuming the divide step takes constant time)

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
function findPeakDivideConquer(arr, start, end):
    mid = start + (end - start) / 2
    
    # Compare the middle element with its neighbors
    if (mid == 0 or arr[mid - 1] <= arr[mid]) and (mid == length(arr) - 1 or arr[mid + 1] <= arr[mid]):
        return mid
    
    # If the middle element is less than its left neighbor, search in the left half
    if mid > 0 and arr[mid - 1] > arr[mid]:
        return findPeakDivideConquer(arr, start, mid - 1)
    
    # If the middle element is less than its right neighbor, search in the right half
    return findPeakDivideConquer(arr, mid + 1, end)
